ltaglib - a TagLib wrapper for Lua

To install this, you'll need Lua 5.1 headers and TagLib.
On a Debian-based Linux system, this means the packages:

   libtag1-dev
   liblua5.1-0

This builds a ltaglib.so, which you can add to a directory in Lua's package.cpath and load with:

     require('ltaglib')

Full documentation on using the wrapper is at:
